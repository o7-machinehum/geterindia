Ryan and Mohan met while working at the same company in Basel, Switzerland. They quickly bonded over beers, cooking and the Basel casino. What you'll find here is: Indian food, Canadian food or something in between.

I find myself constantly irritated by web bloat and the modern web in general. For whatever reason, recipe sites seem to be the pinnacle of this: littered with ads, auto-playing videos, and trackers bordering on malware. You won’t—and will never—find any of that here. Some recipes may contain “lore” sections; if you’re interested in reading more about where I got the recipe, you can find a link at the top. Otherwise, everything is directly to the point.
