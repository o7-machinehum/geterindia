### Ingredients
* 8 oz whole wheat elbow macaroni (or your favorite whole grain pasta)
* 1 small head cauliflower, cut into florets (for pasta and extra sauce)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 1 ½ cups low-fat milk (or unsweetened almond milk)
* 1 teaspoon mustard powder
* 1 cup shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese
* ½ cup grated mozzarella cheese

### Instructions
  - **Cook Pasta & Cauliflower:** In a large pot, cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente. At the same time, steam or boil the cauliflower florets until tender (about 8–10 minutes). Reserve 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower for the sauce.
  - **Prepare Cauliflower Puree:** Blend the reserved cauliflower with the low-fat milk until smooth.
  - **Make the Sauce:** In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and sauté the minced garlic for about 1 minute. Stir in the whole wheat flour to form a light roux, then gradually whisk in the cauliflower-milk puree. Allow the mixture to simmer for 3–5 minutes until it thickens. Stir in the mustard powder, and season with salt and pepper.
  - **Melt the Cheeses:** Lower the heat and stir in the shredded cheddar and grated Parmesan until the cheese melts completely and the sauce becomes smooth.
  - **Combine & Serve:** Mix the cooked pasta into the sauce until evenly coated. For a baked version, transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish, sprinkle with optional whole wheat breadcrumbs and extra toppings, and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 10–15 minutes until the top is lightly golden. Serve warm.
