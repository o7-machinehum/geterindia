### Ingredients

* 4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for a vegetarian version)
* 1 cup water
* 1-2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger (optional, for extra flavor)
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional, for a thicker soup)
* 2 large eggs
* Salt and white pepper, to taste
* 1-2 green onions, thinly sliced (for garnish)
* A few drops of sesame oil (optional)
### Instructions

  - Prepare the Broth: In a medium pot, combine the chicken broth and water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. If using ginger, add it and simmer for about 2 minutes.
  - Thicken the Soup (Optional): In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a couple of tablespoons of cold water to form a slurry. Slowly stir the slurry into the simmering broth and continue simmering for 1-2 minutes until the broth slightly thickens.
  - Create the Egg Ribbons: Beat the eggs in a small bowl until well mixed. With the broth gently simmering, slowly pour the beaten eggs into the pot in a thin, steady stream while stirring gently with a fork or chopsticks to form silky egg ribbons.
  - Season and Serve: Season the soup with salt and white pepper to taste. Remove from heat, stir in a few drops of sesame oil if desired, and garnish with sliced green onions before serving.
