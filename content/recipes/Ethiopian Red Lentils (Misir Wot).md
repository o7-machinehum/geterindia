### Ingredients (Spice Mix)
* 2 tablespoons berbere spice mix
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

### Ingredients
* 1 cup red lentils (rinsed)
* 3 cups water or vegetable broth
* 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1-inch piece ginger, minced
* 2 medium tomatoes, finely chopped (or 3 tablespoons tomato paste)
* 2 tablespoons niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter) (or substitute with 2 tablespoons olive oil + pinch fenugreek + pinch cardamom)
* Salt to taste

### Instructions
  - Cook Lentils: In a medium pot, combine red lentils with water/broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 12–15 minutes until soft. Set aside.
  - Make the Base: Heat niter kibbeh (or oil mix) in a skillet or pot over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until golden brown (8–10 minutes). Add garlic and ginger; cook 1 more minute.
  - Add Tomatoes: Stir in chopped tomatoes (or tomato paste) and cook until softened and the mixture thickens (5–7 minutes).
  - Add the Spices: Stir in berbere, cumin, and black pepper. Cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
  - Combine Lentils: Add cooked lentils to the skillet. Mix well, adding a splash of water or broth for a creamy consistency. Simmer 5 minutes to let flavors meld.
  - Final Touches: Adjust salt to taste. For extra heat, add a pinch more berbere. Serve warm with injera or rice.
