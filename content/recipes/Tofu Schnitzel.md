### Ingredients
* 1 block firm or extra-firm tofu (pressed)
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup breadcrumbs (panko works best for extra crispiness)
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* ½ tsp salt
* ½ tsp black pepper
* ½ cup plant-based milk (unsweetened)
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)
* Oil for frying (canola or sunflower oil works well)


### Instructions
  - **Press the tofu:** Remove excess moisture by pressing the tofu block for at least 15-20 minutes. Once pressed, slice the tofu into ¼ inch thick cutlets.
  - ** Marinate the tofu: **  In a shallow bowl, mix the soy sauce and plant-based milk. Marinate the tofu slices for about 10-15 minutes, ensuring both sides absorb the flavors.
  - ** Prepare the breading station: ** Bowl 1: Place the flour mixed with garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Bowl 2: Pour the remaining plant-based milk or soy sauce marinade. Bowl 3: Mix the breadcrumbs and nutritional yeast (optional for extra flavor and a cheesy taste).
  - **Bread the tofu:** Take each tofu slice, coat it in the flour mixture, dip it in the milk mixture, and finally press it into the breadcrumbs, making sure the tofu is fully coated.
  - **Fry the tofu schnitzel:** Medium heat, heat oil, fry for 3,4 mins

## Gravy Schnitzel

### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 2 cups mushrooms, sliced (white button or cremini work well)
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 cups vegetable or beef broth (depending on preference)
* 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce (optional, for added depth)
* 1/2 teaspoon thyme or rosemary (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1/4 cup heavy cream (optional, for a creamier gravy)

### Instructions
  - Heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
  - Add the onions and sauté for 2-3 minutes until softened.
  - Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes.
  - Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir, cooking for another minute to get rid of the raw flour taste.
  - Slowly add the broth, stirring constantly, to create a smooth gravy.
  - Add soy sauce (if using) and season with thyme/rosemary, salt, and pepper. Let the gravy simmer for 5-10 minutes, until it thickens to your desired consistency.
  - If you prefer a creamier texture, stir in the heavy cream at the end.
