### Ingredients (Spice Mix)
* ⅓ cup plain Greek yogurt or vegan coconut-yogurt  
* 2 Tbsp mayonnaise or vegan mayo  
* 1 Tbsp mild curry powder  
* ½ tsp ground turmeric  
* ¼ tsp ground cumin  
* 1 Tbsp lemon juice  
* 1 tsp maple syrup or honey (optional)  
* Salt & pepper, to taste  

### Ingredients
* 2 cans (400 g each) chickpeas, drained and rinsed  
* 4–6 large flour tortillas or flatbreads  
* 1 cup shredded carrots  
* 1 cup thinly sliced cucumber  
* 1 cup baby spinach or mixed lettuce leaves  
* ½ small red onion, very thinly sliced  
* Fresh cilantro or mint leaves (optional)  
* Sliced avocado (optional)  

### Instructions
  - **Make the chickpea curry salad:** In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, mayo, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, lemon juice, and maple syrup until smooth. Gently fold in the chickpeas until evenly coated. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill for at least 30 minutes (up to 4 hours).  
  - **Prep the veggies:** While the chickpea salad chills, shred the carrots, slice the cucumber and red onion, and wash the greens.  
  - **Assemble the wraps:** Lay a tortilla flat. In the center, layer a handful of spinach, then about ⅓ cup of the chilled chickpea curry salad. Top with shredded carrot, cucumber, red onion, and a few cilantro or mint leaves. Add avocado slices if using.  
  - **Roll and chill:** Fold the bottom edge up over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll tightly. Wrap each in parchment or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes before serving to help them hold together. Slice in half on the diagonal and enjoy cold or at room temperature.
