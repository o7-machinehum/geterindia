### Ingredients (Marinade)
* ½ cup plain yogurt (or coconut/almond yogurt for a vegan option)
* 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
* 1 tablespoon tandoori masala powder
* ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
* ½ teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon oil
* *Optional:* ½ teaspoon garam masala

### Ingredients
* 1 block (14–16 oz) firm or extra-firm tofu, pressed and cut into 1-inch cubes
* Various peppers
* Red Onion
* Garnish: Fresh cilantro or mint leaves, lemon wedges, and mint chutney (or your favorite dipping sauce)

### Instructions
  - **Prepare the Tofu:** Press the tofu for at least 15–20 minutes to remove excess moisture, then cut into uniform 1-inch cubes.
  - **Make the Marinade:** In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, tandoori masala, turmeric, red chili powder, salt, lemon juice, oil, and optional garam masala until smooth.
  - **Marinate the Tofu:** Gently toss the tofu cubes in the marinade ensuring each piece is well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to overnight for a stronger flavor).
  - **Cooking Options:**
    * **Baking:** Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking tray and arrange the tofu in a single layer. Bake for 20–25 minutes, turning halfway through, until the edges are slightly charred and crispy.
    * **Grilling:** Preheat your grill to medium-high. Thread the tofu onto skewers (soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes if using) and grill for about 3–4 minutes per side until nicely charred.
  - **Garnish and Serve:** Transfer the cooked tofu to a serving plate, garnish with fresh cilantro or mint, add a squeeze of lemon juice, and serve hot with mint chutney or your preferred dipping sauce.
