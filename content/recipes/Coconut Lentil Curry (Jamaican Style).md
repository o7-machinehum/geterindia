### Ingredients (Spice Mix)
* 2 tablespoons curry powder
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon allspice

### Ingredients
* 1-2 tablespoons of oil (avocado oil recommended)
* 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
* 1/2 medium red bell pepper, chopped
* 2 green onions, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon ginger, grated
* 2 sprigs of thyme
* 2 vegetable bouillon cubes or equivalent paste
* 1 cup dried lentils, sorted and washed
* 1 (15-ounces) can coconut milk
* 5 cups water, divided
* 1 medium carrot, chopped
* 1 large potato, peeled and chopped
* 1/2 batch of Dumplings (optional)
* 1 Scotch Bonnet pepper, or 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper for heat
### Instructions
  - **Prepare the Base:** Start by heating some oil in a large saucepan. Add chopped onion and cook until soft. Then, include chopped red bell pepper, green onions, grated ginger, minced garlic, and a few sprigs of thyme, cooking until everything becomes fragrant.
  - **Add Spices:** To the saut√©ed vegetables, add curry powder, cumin, paprika, allspice, and vegetable bouillon. Stir and cook for about a minute to let the spices bloom.
  - **Incorporate Lentils and Coconut Milk:** Add your lentils to the pot along with coconut milk. Stir well so that the lentils are fully coated with the spice mixture.
  - **Simmer:** Add water to the pot (the recipe uses about 5 cups, divided), and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover the saucepan and lower the heat to simmer. You'll let this cook for about 45 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.
  - **Add Vegetables:** After the lentils are tender, add additional water along with chopped carrot and potato (and dumplings if you're using them). Bring back to a boil, then reduce to a simmer again until the vegetables are cooked through, about 15 minutes.
  - **Adjust Thickness and Season:** If your stew is thicker than you'd like, you can add a bit more water or vegetable broth to reach your desired consistency. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt if needed.
