### Ingredients (sauce)
* ½ cup nutritional yeast flakes  
* ⅓ cup water  
* ⅓ cup tamari or soy sauce  
* ⅓ cup apple cider vinegar  
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed  
* 1½ cups vegetable oil  
* 2 tbsp tahini paste  

### Ingredients
* 8 cups cooked brown rice  
* 2 cups beets, grated  
* 2 cups carrots, grated  
* 2 cups almonds, toasted  
* 2 cups spinach leaves  
* 2 cups tofu, cubed  

### Instructions
  - **Prepare the Rice:** Cook brown rice according to package directions and set aside.  
  - **Sauté the Tofu:** Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and sauté the tofu cubes until golden brown on all sides. Remove and keep warm.  
  - **Blend the Dressing:** In a blender, combine nutritional yeast flakes, water, tamari (or soy sauce), apple cider vinegar, tahini paste, and crushed garlic. Blend until smooth, then with the blender running, pour in the vegetable oil in a steady stream to emulsify. (You’ll have extra dressing—store for future use.)  
  - **Assemble the Bowls:** Divide cooked brown rice among 8 bowls. Top each with grated beets, grated carrots, spinach leaves, toasted almonds, and sautéed tofu.  
  - **Finish & Serve:** Drizzle each bowl generously with the Glory Bowl dressing and serve immediately.
