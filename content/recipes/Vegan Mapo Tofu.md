### Ingredients
* 4 tbsp (60 ml) vegetable oil
* ½ tbsp (10 g) Sichuan peppercorns, coarsely ground (reserve ¼ tsp / 0.5 g for garnish)
* 3 tbsp (25 g) ginger, finely minced
* 3 tbsp (25 g) garlic, finely minced
* 1 tbsp (10 g) fermented black beans
* 1–2 Thai bird chilies, thinly sliced
* 4 oz (110 g) shiitake mushrooms, finely chopped
* 2 tbsp (20–40 g) spicy bean sauce (adjust to taste)
* 1 tbsp (15 ml) chili oil
* ⅔ cup (160 ml) water, vegetable broth, or mushroom broth
* 2 tsp (6 g) cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp (15 ml) water
* 1 lb (450 g) silken or soft tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes
* ¼ tsp (1 ml) sesame oil
* ¼ tsp (1 g) sugar
* 1 scallion, finely chopped

### Instructions
- **Infuse the oil:** Heat the vegetable oil in a wok over medium-low. Add the ground Sichuan peppercorns (reserve ¼ tsp for garnish). Cook for 30 seconds.
- **Add aromatics:** Stir in the ginger, cook 1 minute. Add the garlic, cook 1 minute more. Add fermented black beans and chilies, cook another 1–2 minutes.
- **Cook mushrooms:** Increase heat to medium. Add mushrooms and cook until reduced and lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes.
- **Season:** Stir in the spicy bean sauce and chili oil. Increase heat to high, add broth (or water), stir, and bring to a simmer. Let bubble for 1 minute.
- **Thicken:** Stir the cornstarch slurry to ensure it’s dissolved, then add to the wok. Cook until the sauce thickens. If too thick, add a splash more broth; if too thin, add extra slurry.
- **Add tofu:** Gently fold in the tofu cubes. Simmer 3–5 minutes.
- **Finish:** Add sesame oil, sugar, and scallions. Stir gently, adjust seasoning if needed.
- **Serve:** Garnish with reserved ground Sichuan peppercorns.
