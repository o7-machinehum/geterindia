* 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste  
* 1 tbsp red chili powder  
* Salt, to taste  
* 1 tsp kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves)  
* ½ tsp garam masala  
* 2 tbsp Kashmiri chili powder  

### Ingredients
* 300 g boneless chicken breast  
* Oil, for pan-frying  
* 500 g tomatoes, roughly slit  
* 100 g onions, roughly chopped  
* 1 tbsp garlic paste  
* 50 g cashews  
* 4 tbsp sugar  
* 5 tbsp butter  
* 3 tbsp cream  
* 2 tbsp malt vinegar (or 1½ tbsp white vinegar)  
* Water, as needed  
* Garnish: extra cream & kasoori methi  

### Instructions
- **Marinate the Chicken:** In a bowl, combine chicken with 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste, 1 tbsp red chili powder, and salt. Cover and rest for 15–20 minutes.  
- **Pan-fry Chicken:** Heat a little oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the marinated chicken pieces until cooked through and lightly browned. Remove to a bowl.  
- **Build the Gravy Base:** In the same pan, add a knob of butter and a splash of oil. Sauté chopped onions until translucent. Add slit tomatoes and cashews; cook until tomatoes soften.  
- **Season & Simmer:** Stir in garlic paste, sugar, malt vinegar, salt, Kashmiri chili powder, kasoori methi, and garam masala. Add a splash of water, mix well, and simmer for 15–20 minutes.  
- **Puree & Strain:** Transfer the gravy to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain back into the pan, pressing out all the liquid.  
- **Finish the Curry:** Stir in remaining butter and cream. Return the fried chicken to the pan, coat with the sauce, and simmer for 5–7 minutes.  
- **Garnish & Serve:** Drizzle with extra cream, sprinkle a pinch of kasoori methi, and serve hot with naan or rice.
