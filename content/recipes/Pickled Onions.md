### Ingredients (brine)
* 1 cup (240 ml) white vinegar or apple cider vinegar  
* ½ cup (120 ml) water  
* 1–2 tbsp granulated sugar  
* 1 tsp salt  
* Optional aromatics:  
  * 5–6 whole black peppercorns  
  * 1 small garlic clove, smashed  
  * ½ tsp red‑pepper flakes  

### Ingredients
* 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced  

### Instructions
  - **Prep the Onion:** Peel and cut the onion in half; slice into very thin (2–3 mm) half‑moons.  
  - **Make the Brine:** In a small saucepan, combine vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and any aromatics. Bring just to a simmer, stirring until sugar and salt dissolve.  
  - **Jar & Steep:** Place the onion slices in a heatproof jar or bowl. Pour the hot brine over them, ensuring they’re fully submerged. Let sit 15–20 minutes at room temperature.  
  - **Use & Store:** Once bright pink and softened, they’re ready! Store sealed in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
