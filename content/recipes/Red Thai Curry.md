#### Red Curry Paste
* 10-15 small red dried chili pepper
* 2 shallot, chopped
* 6 garlic cloves
* 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and chopped
* 2 stalk of lemongrass, finely chopped
* Galangal: 2 inches, peeled and chopped (can substitute with ginger if necessary)
* Kaffir Lime Zest: 1 teaspoon (substitute with regular lime zest if needed)
* Coriander Roots: 1 tablespoon (or use coriander stems if roots are unavailable)
* Cilantro (Coriander) Leaves: 1/4 cup, chopped
* A small bunch of cilantro (including stems)
* Cumin Seeds: 1 teaspoon, toasted
* Coriander Seeds: 1 teaspoon, toasted
* White Peppercorns: 1 teaspoon (or use black peppercorns)
* Shrimp Paste (Kapi): 1 tablespoon (omit or use a vegetarian substitute for a vegan version)


#### Red Curry Paste (Instructions)
  - **Prepare the Chilies**: After soaking the dried chilies, drain them and remove any stems. If you prefer a milder paste, you can also remove some or all of the seeds.
  - **Toast the Seeds:** In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the cumin and coriander seeds until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Let them cool, then grind them into a powder using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.
  - **Chop Ingredients**: Finely chop the lemongrass, galangal, garlic, shallots, and coriander roots (or stems) to make them easier to blend.
  - **Blend the Ingredients**: In a blender or food processor, combine the softened chilies, chopped ingredients, ground cumin and coriander, white peppercorns, kaffir lime zest, cilantro leaves, shrimp paste, and salt. Blend until the mixture forms a smooth paste. You may need to add a little water to help the blending process, but try to keep it as minimal as possible for a concentrated paste.
  - **Adjust to Taste**: Taste the curry paste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. If it needs more salt, you can add a bit more shrimp paste or salt.
  - **Store**: Transfer the curry paste to a jar and cover it with a thin layer of oil to help preserve it. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a month or frozen in portions for future use.


#### Red Curry

* Red Curry Paste: 3 tablespoons (store-bought or homemade)
* Coconut Milk: 2 cans (400 ml each), preferably full-fat for a richer curry
* Protein: 500 grams (about 1 pound) of your choice (chicken, beef, tofu, or shrimp), cut into bite-sized pieces
* Vegetables: 2 cups of vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, bamboo shoots, green beans, and baby corn)
* Basil Leaves: A handful of Thai basil leaves (can substitute with sweet basil if necessary)
* Fish Sauce: 2 tablespoons, adjust to taste
* Brown Sugar: 1 tablespoon, adjust to taste
* Kaffir Lime Leaves: 4-5 leaves, torn (optional for extra flavor)
* Oil: 1 tablespoon, for frying
* Water: ½ cup, if needed to adjust consistency
* Lime Juice: From 1 lime, to finish

#### Red Curry (Instructions)
* **Prepare Ingredients**: Cut the protein and vegetables into bite-sized pieces. If using chicken or beef, it’s best to slice them thinly for quick cooking.
* **Cook the Curry Paste**: Heat a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the oil and red curry paste, frying it for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. This helps release the flavors.
* **Add Protein**: Add your choice of protein to the skillet and stir-fry it with the paste for 3-4 minutes, or until it starts to cook on all sides.
* **Add Coconut Milk**: Pour in the coconut milk, stirring well to combine with the curry paste. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.
* **Add Vegetables**: Add the prepared vegetables to the skillet. If you’re using vegetables that take longer to cook (like carrots), add them earlier. For quicker-cooking veggies (like bell peppers), add them a bit later.
* **Season the Curry**: Add the fish sauce and brown sugar, adjusting these to taste. If you have kaffir lime leaves, add them here.
* **Simmer**: Let the curry simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the protein is cooked through. If the curry seems too thick, you can add a little water to reach your desired consistency. 
* **Final Touches**: Just before serving, stir in the basil leaves and squeeze in the lime juice. Give it a final taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.
* **Serve**: Serve hot with steamed jasmine rice or rice noodles.
