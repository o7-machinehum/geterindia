### Ingredients (Peanut Sauce)
* 1/3 cup smooth peanut butter
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 1–2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey (adjust to taste)
* 1 teaspoon sriracha (optional, adjust for heat)
* Juice of 1 lime (optional, for tang)
* 1/4–1/3 cup water (to thin out the sauce as needed)

### Ingredients
* 12–14 oz udon noodles (fresh or dry; follow package instructions)
* 1 block of Tofu
* 1 red bell pepper, julienned
* 1 large carrot, peeled and cut into matchsticks
* 1–2 cups broccoli florets, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 1 cup snap peas or snow peas, trimmed
* 1 cup mushrooms (shiitake, cremini, or button), sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated
* 1–2 tablespoons oil (vegetable, canola, or sesame)
* Chopped roasted peanuts
* sliced green onions
* fresh cilantro
* lime wedges

### Instructions
  - **Prepare the Noodles:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the udon noodles and cook according to the package instructions until just tender. Drain and rinse briefly under cold water to stop the cooking process. Toss with a tiny bit of oil to prevent sticking.
  - **Make the Peanut Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup (or honey), sriracha, lime juice, and water until smooth. Adjust the consistency and seasoning as needed.
  - **Stir-Fry the Vegetables:** Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger; sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the red bell pepper, carrot, broccoli, snap peas, and mushrooms. Stir-fry for 4–5 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.
  - **Combine Noodles and Sauce:** Add the cooked udon noodles to the pan with the vegetables. Pour the peanut sauce over the noodles and toss well to ensure everything is evenly coated. Stir-fry for an additional 2 minutes to meld the flavors; add a splash of water if the sauce seems too thick.
  - **Finish and Serve:** Remove from heat and transfer to serving bowls. Garnish with chopped roasted peanuts, sliced green onions, fresh cilantro, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges on the side for an extra burst of tang.
