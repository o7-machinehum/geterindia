### Ingredients (Sauce)
* 1 tbsp doenjang
* 1 tsp gochujang (optional, for a bit of heat)
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp maple syrup or honey (for a nice caramelized finish)
* 1 tbsp rice vinegar
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1-2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 tsp grated ginger
* Cutup chives

### Ingredients
* 1 block of firm tofu, cut into thick slices or cubes
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil (for pan-frying)
* Sticky Rice
* Grated carrots
* Grated cucumber
* Kimchi
* Green onions

### Instructions
  - Prepare the Tofu: Press the tofu for about 15-20 minutes to remove excess water, helping it absorb the glaze better.
  - Make the Glaze: In a small bowl, mix the doenjang, gochujang (if using), soy sauce, maple syrup or honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger.
  - Pan-Fry the Tofu: Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu slices or cubes and cook until golden brown on all sides.
  - Glaze the Tofu: Reduce the heat to low. Pour the glaze over the tofu and gently toss to coat, allowing the glaze to caramelize slightly on the tofu, about 1-2 minutes.
  - Serve: Remove from heat and serve hot, topped with green onions or sesame seeds if desired.
