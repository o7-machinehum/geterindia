### Ingredients (Spice Mix)
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* Pinch of ground fenugreek (optional)

### Ingredients
* 1 cup green lentils (rinsed)
* 3 cups water or vegetable broth
* 2 cups fresh spinach, chopped
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1-inch piece ginger, minced
* 2 tablespoons niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter)  
    (or substitute with 2 tablespoons olive oil + pinch fenugreek + pinch cardamom)
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional, for brightness)
* Salt to taste

### Instructions
  - Cook Lentils: In a medium pot, combine lentils with water/broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20–25 minutes until tender but not mushy. Drain if needed and set aside.
  - Make the Base: Heat niter kibbeh (or oil mix) in a skillet or pot over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until soft and golden (6–8 minutes). Add garlic and ginger; cook 1 more minute.
  - Add the Spices: Stir in turmeric, cumin, pepper, and optional fenugreek. Cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
  - Combine Lentils: Add cooked lentils to the skillet. Mix well, adding a splash of water or broth for a creamy consistency. Simmer 5 minutes.
  - Add Spinach: Stir in chopped spinach and cook just until wilted (1–2 minutes).
  - Final Touches: Add lemon juice if using. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm with injera, rice, or flatbread.
