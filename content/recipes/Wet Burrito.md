### Instructions
Cook the Filling:

  - In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the vegetable oil (if using).
  - Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Once the beef is halfway browned, add diced onion and minced garlic.
  - Continue cooking until the beef is fully browned and the onion is soft. Drain any excess fat if necessary.
  - Stir in chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired.
  - Add in beans (and cooked rice, if using). Stir well to combine, then remove from heat.

Prepare the Sauce:

  - In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.
  - Whisk in the flour to form a roux, cooking for about 1 minute (this helps cook out the raw flour taste).
  - Slowly pour in the broth, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
  - Stir in the enchilada sauce, chili powder, and cumin.
  - Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and cook for about 3–5 minutes, until slightly thickened.
  - Season with salt and pepper to taste, then remove from heat.

Assemble the Burritos:

  - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
  - Warm the tortillas in the microwave or on a hot skillet to make them more pliable.
  - Place a scoop of the beef-bean filling in the center of each tortilla. Add a handful of shredded cheese on top of the filling (reserve about half for topping later).
  - Fold the sides of the tortilla in, then roll it up from bottom to top, tucking in the filling snugly to form a burrito.

Smother and Bake:

  - Lightly grease a baking dish (or line with foil for easy cleanup).
  - Arrange the burritos seam-side down in the dish.
  - Pour the warm sauce evenly over the burritos, making sure they’re well-covered.
  - Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese on top.
  - Bake uncovered for 15–20 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is bubbly around the edges.

Garnish and Serve:

  - Carefully remove from the oven.
  - Add your desired toppings: shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, jalapeños, olives, sour cream, guacamole, or fresh cilantro.
  - Serve the wet burritos while hot.
