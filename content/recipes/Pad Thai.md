### Ingredients (Sauce Mix)
* 3 tablespoons of soy sauce or tamari (for gluten-free option)
* 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste
* 1 tablespoon of sugar (or a sugar substitute like maple syrup)
* 1 teaspoon of chili sauce or Sriracha (adjust to taste)
* 1/2 cup of water

### Ingredients
* 8 ounces of flat rice noodles
* 2 tablespoons of oil (vegetable or canola)
* 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
* 1 carrot, julienned or grated
* 2 green onions, chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 cup of bean sprouts
* 1/2 cup of unsalted roasted peanuts, chopped
* 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro, chopped
* 1 lime, cut into wedges=
* 2 eggs (optional, can be omitted for a vegan version)


### Instructions
  - **Prepare the Noodles:** Soak the rice noodles in hot water for about 8-10 minutes, or until they are soft but still firm to the bite. Drain and set aside.
  - **Make the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, tamarind paste, sugar, chili sauce, and water until well combined. Set aside.
  - **Cook the Veggies:** Heat the oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the red bell pepper and carrot, and stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes, or until just tender. Add the green onions and garlic, cooking for an additional minute.
  - **Egg Option:** Push the veggies to one side of the pan. If using eggs, crack them into the pan and scramble until fully cooked, then mix with the vegetables.
  - **Combine:** Add the drained noodles and the prepared sauce to the pan. Toss everything together and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the noodles are heated through and have absorbed the sauce.
  - **Serve:** Remove from heat. Stir in the bean sprouts and most of the peanuts and cilantro, saving some for garnish. Serve hot with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the top.
  - **Garnish:** Sprinkle the remaining peanuts and cilantro over each serving.
