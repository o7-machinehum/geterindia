### Ingredients (Spice Mix)
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)

### Ingredients
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp harissa paste*, see note
* 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 4-6 eggs
* Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped (for garnish)
* Crumbled feta cheese (optional)

### Instructions

  - Sauté Vegetables: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and red bell pepper, and cook until softened (about 5–7 minutes).
  - Add Garlic and Spices: Stir in the minced garlic along with the cumin, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper and harissa paste. Cook for another 1–2 minutes until the spices are fragrant.
  - Simmer the Sauce: Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes until it thickens slightly.
  - Poach the Eggs: Make small wells in the sauce and gently crack an egg into each well. Cover the skillet and cook until the eggs reach your desired doneness (about 5–8 minutes for runny yolks).
  - Garnish and Serve: Remove the skillet from the heat, garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley and a sprinkle of crumbled feta cheese if using. Serve immediately with crusty bread or pita for dipping.
