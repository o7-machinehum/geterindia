### Ingredients
 
* Dry
	* 1 cup all-purpose flour  
	* 2 tbsp sugar  
	* 2 tsp baking powder  
	* ½ tsp salt  
	
* Wet
	* 1 cup milk (dairy or plant-based)  
	* 2 tbsp melted butter or oil  
	* 1 tsp vanilla extract  
* Butter or oil for cooking  
* Blueberries
* Bananas

### Instructions
  - **Mix dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  
  - **Combine wet ingredients:** In another bowl, whisk together milk, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract.  
  - **Make the batter:** Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Do not overmix—some small lumps are fine.  
  - **Cook the pancakes:** Heat a lightly oiled skillet or griddle over medium heat. Pour about ¼ cup of batter per pancake onto the skillet.  
  - **Flip when bubbles form:** Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look set, then flip and cook for another 1–2 minutes until golden brown.  
  - **Serve:** Stack warm pancakes and serve with maple syrup, fruit, or your favorite toppings.
