  <h1>Red Thai Curry</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h4 id="red-curry-paste">Red Curry Paste</h4>
<ul>
<li>10-15 small red dried chili pepper</li>
<li>2 shallot, chopped</li>
<li>6 garlic cloves</li>
<li>2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and chopped</li>
<li>2 stalk of lemongrass, finely chopped</li>
<li>Galangal: 2 inches, peeled and chopped (can substitute with ginger if necessary)</li>
<li>Kaffir Lime Zest: 1 teaspoon (substitute with regular lime zest if needed)</li>
<li>Coriander Roots: 1 tablespoon (or use coriander stems if roots are unavailable)</li>
<li>Cilantro (Coriander) Leaves: 1/4 cup, chopped</li>
<li>A small bunch of cilantro (including stems)</li>
<li>Cumin Seeds: 1 teaspoon, toasted</li>
<li>Coriander Seeds: 1 teaspoon, toasted</li>
<li>White Peppercorns: 1 teaspoon (or use black peppercorns)</li>
<li>Shrimp Paste (Kapi): 1 tablespoon (omit or use a vegetarian substitute for a vegan version)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="red-curry-paste-instructions">Red Curry Paste (Instructions)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare the Chilies</strong>: After soaking the dried chilies, drain them and remove any stems. If you prefer a milder paste, you can also remove some or all of the seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Toast the Seeds:</strong> In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the cumin and coriander seeds until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Let them cool, then grind them into a powder using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.</li>
<li><strong>Chop Ingredients</strong>: Finely chop the lemongrass, galangal, garlic, shallots, and coriander roots (or stems) to make them easier to blend.</li>
<li><strong>Blend the Ingredients</strong>: In a blender or food processor, combine the softened chilies, chopped ingredients, ground cumin and coriander, white peppercorns, kaffir lime zest, cilantro leaves, shrimp paste, and salt. Blend until the mixture forms a smooth paste. You may need to add a little water to help the blending process, but try to keep it as minimal as possible for a concentrated paste.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust to Taste</strong>: Taste the curry paste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. If it needs more salt, you can add a bit more shrimp paste or salt.</li>
<li><strong>Store</strong>: Transfer the curry paste to a jar and cover it with a thin layer of oil to help preserve it. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a month or frozen in portions for future use.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="red-curry">Red Curry</h4>
<ul>
<li>Red Curry Paste: 3 tablespoons (store-bought or homemade)</li>
<li>Coconut Milk: 2 cans (400 ml each), preferably full-fat for a richer curry</li>
<li>Protein: 500 grams (about 1 pound) of your choice (chicken, beef, tofu, or shrimp), cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
<li>Vegetables: 2 cups of vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, bamboo shoots, green beans, and baby corn)</li>
<li>Basil Leaves: A handful of Thai basil leaves (can substitute with sweet basil if necessary)</li>
<li>Fish Sauce: 2 tablespoons, adjust to taste</li>
<li>Brown Sugar: 1 tablespoon, adjust to taste</li>
<li>Kaffir Lime Leaves: 4-5 leaves, torn (optional for extra flavor)</li>
<li>Oil: 1 tablespoon, for frying</li>
<li>Water: ½ cup, if needed to adjust consistency</li>
<li>Lime Juice: From 1 lime, to finish</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="red-curry-instructions">Red Curry (Instructions)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare Ingredients</strong>: Cut the protein and vegetables into bite-sized pieces. If using chicken or beef, it’s best to slice them thinly for quick cooking.</li>
<li><strong>Cook the Curry Paste</strong>: Heat a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the oil and red curry paste, frying it for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. This helps release the flavors.</li>
<li><strong>Add Protein</strong>: Add your choice of protein to the skillet and stir-fry it with the paste for 3-4 minutes, or until it starts to cook on all sides.</li>
<li><strong>Add Coconut Milk</strong>: Pour in the coconut milk, stirring well to combine with the curry paste. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.</li>
<li><strong>Add Vegetables</strong>: Add the prepared vegetables to the skillet. If you’re using vegetables that take longer to cook (like carrots), add them earlier. For quicker-cooking veggies (like bell peppers), add them a bit later.</li>
<li><strong>Season the Curry</strong>: Add the fish sauce and brown sugar, adjusting these to taste. If you have kaffir lime leaves, add them here.</li>
<li><strong>Simmer</strong>: Let the curry simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the protein is cooked through. If the curry seems too thick, you can add a little water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Final Touches</strong>: Just before serving, stir in the basil leaves and squeeze in the lime juice. Give it a final taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Serve</strong>: Serve hot with steamed jasmine rice or rice noodles.</li>
</ul>
