  <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>8 oz whole wheat elbow macaroni (or your favorite whole grain pasta)</li>
<li>1 small head cauliflower, cut into florets (for pasta and extra sauce)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
<li>1 ½ cups low-fat milk (or unsweetened almond milk)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
<li>1 cup shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese</li>
<li>½ cup grated mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cook Pasta &amp; Cauliflower:</strong> In a large pot, cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente. At the same time, steam or boil the cauliflower florets until tender (about 8–10 minutes). Reserve 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower for the sauce.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare Cauliflower Puree:</strong> Blend the reserved cauliflower with the low-fat milk until smooth.</li>
<li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and sauté the minced garlic for about 1 minute. Stir in the whole wheat flour to form a light roux, then gradually whisk in the cauliflower-milk puree. Allow the mixture to simmer for 3–5 minutes until it thickens. Stir in the mustard powder, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li><strong>Melt the Cheeses:</strong> Lower the heat and stir in the shredded cheddar and grated Parmesan until the cheese melts completely and the sauce becomes smooth.</li>
<li><strong>Combine &amp; Serve:</strong> Mix the cooked pasta into the sauce until evenly coated. For a baked version, transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish, sprinkle with optional whole wheat breadcrumbs and extra toppings, and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 10–15 minutes until the top is lightly golden. Serve warm.</li>
